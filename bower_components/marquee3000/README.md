# MARQUEE3000

Marquees for the new millenium âœ¨

Super smooth and versatile javaScript plugin with no dependencies.

ðŸ‘„

Note: Marquees were a bit neglected, no? There are tons,
but they're slow and you can't really do much with them.
So much you can do with the inherently strong typographic
look of em. So this is me trying to update them for 2017.

## Features
- ~3kb minified with no dependencies
- Turn any element into a smooth-as-butter marquee
- Text, images++<sup>*</sup> it'll do it
- Style marquees as usual with CSSâ€“ get creative!
- Set orientation, speed and direction
- Have hundreds without any slowdown
- Automatically adjusts if window is scaled up
- Marquee only animates if it's in the viewport

<sup>*</sup>we'll find out more

## Demo
[MARQUEE3000 DEMO MARQUEE3000 DEMO MARQUEE3000 DEMO](https://ezekielaquino.github.io/Marquee3000/)

## Usage

1. Include Marquee3000 in your html file. Download zip or install via `bower install marquee3000` || `npm install marquee3000`

    ```html
        <script src="marquee3k.min.js"></script>
     ```
        
2. Create an element with a `.marquee3k` class. You can pass different options such as speed, orientation and direction (optional). See below for options.

    ```html
        <div class="marquee3k" 
            data-speed="60" â†’ speed in pixels/sec (default: 50)
            data-reverse="bool" â†’ default: R to L / T to B
            data-vertical="bool" â†’ [def] horizontal or [true] vertical
            data-delay="2" â†’ Initial pause before animating (in sec)
            data-pausable="bool" â†’ Pause marquee on hover
            data-hover="bool" â†’ Play marquee on hover
            data-callback="functionName" â†’ function called every cycle>
            MARQUEE3000
            <!--you can even have inline images,
            or any kind of html -->
            <img src="trumpet.jpg" />
        </div>
    ```
        
3. Fill it up with text or images etc. (still finding out what you can do with it)

4. In your js file or `<script>` just call `Marquee3k()` and you're all set!

### Options

You can set additional configuration options.

    Marquee3k({
        selector: '.selector-name', // define a custom classname
        randomSpeed: bool, // if true, each marquee will be assigned a random speed between 10-50px/sec
        resizeDebounce: 500, // in ms, defaults to 500ms
        spacing: 30 // number in px, space between copies - defaults to 30
    });

Marquee also adds a `is-ready` selector. You can use this to add and toggle entrance transitions, for example.

### To Do
- Make it play well with type plugins such as lettering.js or some other scripts
- Some basic implementation of callbacks
- More play options

### Changes in 0.0.3 (Bear with me with the versioning)

- Marquees can now take a onComplete/restart callback by passing `data-callback="functionName"`
- `data-hover` only plays marquee on hover

### Questions

**Q: But it's slow, I have 150+ of them on the same page**

A: If you've got literally hundreds of them on one page, you've got
a marquee addiction problem. Contact a internet professional or
buy me a beer, I think we'd get along quite well.

**Q: Does it work on mobile?**

A: Yes it does and it works quite well! If you're going to be rotating
things and all that fancy stuff, just make sure to style it with CSS.

**Q: Can i make a marquee that's position fixed?**

A: Absolutely. You just have to wrap the marquee element inside another
container which gets the `position: fixed`. Namaste.

**Q: Can you make it spin?**

A: Umm, sure. Well you can do anything with it really *Demo coming soon*

**Q: I have more questions, what's your support hotline?**

A: 1-800-MARQUEE or you can just mention me on twitter (@the_ezekiel)

**Q: the callback does not work?

A: You have to pass in only the name of the function (must be defined in global scope). Still currently a very basic implementation. Suggestions welcome!
